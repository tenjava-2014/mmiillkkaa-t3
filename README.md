# Setup
After the plugin has been placed in the plugins folder and the configuration has been generated, you can run the command
`/setup` which will allow you to change a few things.

# Events

There are two types of events: Events which occur on an interval and events which occur as reactions to others.

These events will occur on the interval set in the configuration:

* Chicken Attack
  * 1-6 chickens appear and begin to attack the player.
* Stalker Derpy Pig
  * A pig appears.
  * When the pig is killed, you get a cat.
* Derpy Zombie
  * Has dirt on its head.
  * Drops a set item as a "reward."
  
These events occur as reactions to other in-game events:

* Giant
  * When lightning strikes a zombie, a giant appears.
